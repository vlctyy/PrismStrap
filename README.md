## About PrismStrap

Welcome to PrismStrap!

PrismStrap is a **fork** of the Roblox client enhancement script originally known as **Bloxstrap**, created by the talented **new-qwertyui**.

This project began with the goal of updating and rebranding the original Bloxstrap script, primarily focusing on changing directory structures, renaming elements, and ensuring continued usability. We aim to build upon the fantastic foundation laid by the original developer.

Our intention is to maintain a version of this script for the community, potentially explore new directions or features in the future, and learn from the sophisticated groundwork already in place.
